## ‚ú® About the Project
RAG Insurance Assistant is an innovative solution crafted to simplify the process of understanding and extracting information from complex insurance documents. Traditional methods of sifting through policy documents, claim guidelines, and legal jargon can be time-consuming and frustrating for users. This project eliminates these pain points by leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, which blends advanced information retrieval with the natural language generation capabilities of state-of-the-art AI models.

Example Use Cases:
- "What is covered under my health insurance policy?"
- "How can I file a claim for vehicle insurance?"

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/SandeepGitGuy/HelpMate_AI_Project_GenAI_UpGrad_IIITB.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd HelpMate_AI_Project_GenAI_UpGrad_IIITB

3. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Please note: OpenAI API keys are required for the project to function. They are currently hardcoded in the code. You can obtain them from the OpenAI website and change the same in the code. We will update the code to make it more dynamic in the future.

4. Run the main script from Jupyter environment:
"helpmate-ai-upgrad_sandeep_b.ipynb"
